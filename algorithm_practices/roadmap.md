Beginner (Foundations)
- Linear Search → Scan through a list one by one. ✅
- Binary Search → Divide and conquer search in sorted data. ✅
- Bubble Sort → Simple sorting by swapping adjacent elements. 
- Selection Sort → Pick the smallest/largest element repeatedly. 
- Insertion Sort → Build sorted list one item at a time. 


Intermediate (Efficiency & Data Structures)
- Merge Sort → Divide-and-conquer sorting, efficient and stable. 
- Quick Sort → Fast sorting using pivot partitioning. 
- Stack & Queue Operations → LIFO vs FIFO structures. 
- Hashing → Fast lookups using hash tables. 
- Tree Traversals → Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, BFS/DFS. 


Advanced (Optimization & Complex Systems)
- Graph Algorithms 
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm (shortest path) 
- Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall (weighted paths) 
- Kruskal’s & Prim’s (minimum spanning tree) 
- Dynamic Programming 
- Fibonacci with memoization 
- Longest Common Subsequence 
- Knapsack  


Expert (Specialized & Hard)
- Advanced Graphs → A* search, Max Flow (Ford-Fulkerson). 
- NP-Complete Problems → Traveling Salesman, SAT problem. 
- Machine Learning Algorithms → Gradient Descent, Decision Trees. 
- Parallel/Distributed Algorithms → MapReduce, consensus protocols.
