# (Constant Changes) C
    The C is Constant changes in the data, let's say that I have a sales in monday with 15 sales, on tuesday I got 34 sales.

    y1 = monday_sales - tuesday_sales
    y1 = 34 - 15 
    y1 = +19

    now we got y1, then there's a new sales in wed which is 60,
    y2 = tuesday_day - wednesday_sales
    y2 = 60 - 34
    y2 = +26

    c = (y2 + y1)/n

    n = how many c we have which is y1 and y2 in count we got 2, the n = 2, if we got y3, the n = 3. As we have only y1 and y2 the n = 2

    c = (y2+y1)/n
    c = (26 + 19)/2
    c = 22.5

    remember that the new data is always at the right and the previous data is always at left which make it y(current) - y(previous)
